Remember Me
===========

This CodeIgniter Spark provides a library for creating and verifying non-forgeable cookies suitable for "Remember Me?" type login checkboxes.

How Does It Work?
=================

Using this library's setCookie() function, the following occurs:

- A cookie is generated containing a unique hash
- This hash is recorded into a database table, called *ci_cookies* along with the netid/username passed on to setCookie()
- When the verifyCookie() function is called the browser's cookie hash must match the hash recorded to the database. If it does, verifyCookie() returns true
- Optionally, developers can provide an authorization check using their own function that will verify the status of the user when the user returns to your site, no session exists, and they have a valid cookie with a matching database entry. This way you can, for instance, include an LDAP check to make sure that this user is still employed by your company so that his/her cookie is destroyed when this check fails

Usage
=====

1. Create your *ci_cookies* table in the database used by your site using the included schema *ci_cookies.sql*
2. If you wish to provide your own authorization check to verify users that have valid cookies but no session information, you will need to inform RememberMe of the model or library where this function resides, as well as this functions's name. See the included sample *config/rememberme.php* for this configuration. If you wish to disable this feature, comment out the *authfunc* config option in this file.
3. Create your login form with a remember me checkbox, and in your application if this checkbox is checked execute the following (where *$this->input->post('netid')* is your form's netid):
	
		$this->rememberme->setCookie($this->input->post('netid'));

4. To verify the cookie, include code such as the following:

		$cookie_user = $this->rememberme->verifyCookie();
		if ($cookie_user) {
			// find user id of cookie_user stored in application database
			$user = User::findUser($cookie_user);
			// set session if necessary
			if (!$this->session->userdata('user_id')) {
				$this->session->set_userdata('user_id', $user);
			}
			$this->user = $user;
		}
		else if ($this->session->userdata('user_id')) {
			$this->user = $this->session->userdata('user_id');
		}
		
I like to put this code in my CodeIgniter core controller so that this authentication check occurs on every page load, and for those pages I want to make public (i.e. not require authentication), I add exceptions where necessary. *$cookie_user* verifies the cookie set in the user's browser with the record in the database, if they have opted to click on your remember me checkbox at login, and the second conditional here involving the *user_id* session variable is for users that have not clicked on the remember me checkbox, but are still considered logged in since they have an active session. The additional stuff in the first conditional involving invoking *User::findUser()* is just some additional stuff you can throw in to make sure that user actually has application info for it, you can tweak this to your liking. Setting the session variable *user_id* is similarly for your convenience for keeping track of the application database information (perhaps containing additional metadata) for that user saved in the cookie. You can tweak this to your liking as well.

The CodeIgniter Session class and Cookie Helper is required by Remember Me and autoloaded for storing the user ID for that session, it is recommended that you use the following configuration options found in your applications main *config/config.php* file:

	$config['sess_expire_on_close']	= TRUE;
	$config['sess_encrypt_cookie']	= TRUE;
	$config['sess_use_database']	= TRUE;
	$config['sess_table_name']		= 'ci_sessions';
	
The *sess_expire_on_close* setting will allow your local sessions to be regenerated at the beginning of each new session upon cookie verification, and the other settings provide some additional security (see the CodeIgniter user guide on creating your *ci_sessions* table). Remember Me will set its own session variable called *rememberme_session* tracking the netid/username of the current user using the CodeIgniter Session class for additional verification. You can use this as a means of tracking the current user within your application, or else supplement this with your own session data. In the above code fragment *$this->session->userdata('user_id')* is tracking the current user numerical ID stored in our database's *users* table (in this case the numerical ID differs from the netid/username), but you name this variable whatever you want, you don't have to stick to the naming schemes used within the above code fragment.

Tracking the Original Landing Page
==================================

You can keep a record of the original page the user requested before rendering/being redirected your login form by running the following on the landing page:

	$this->rememberme->recordOrigPage();
	
and on successful login you can redirect back to this page via the following:

	$this->load->helper('url');
	redirect($this->rememberme->getOrigPage());


Changelog
=========

1.2.2
-----

- bump CodeIgniter compatibility version to 2.1
- improve this README file

1.2.1
-----

- Support setting cookies for localhost

1.2.0
-----

- A bunch of bugfixes to verifyCookie
- Domains are now set in cookies so that Spark can be used on domains and subdomains simultaneously

1.1.1
-----

- Set default orig_page_requested to null value to suppress errors, fix cookie path value

1.1.0
-----

- When recordOrigPage() has been used, these temporary records written to *ci_cookies* are discarded on login, but the *orig_page_requested* value assigned to this record salvaged and recorded along with the rest of the cookie information written to *ci_cookies*. Decided this feature warranted a version bump to 1.1. Also modified autoload.php to autoload CI dependencies, two which were missing from the previous version.


1.0.4
-----

- added recordOrigPage() and getOrigPage() functions. This version has undergone compatibility testing with CodeIgniter 2.0.3, and also requires updating the schema for the *ci_cookies* table. The newer, updated schema can be found in the included *ci_cookies.sql* file. You can also apply the schema update by running the following command:

	ALTER TABLE  `ci_cookies` ADD  `orig_page_requested` VARCHAR( 120 ) NOT NULL ,
	ADD  `php_session_id` VARCHAR( 40 ) NOT NULL

1.0.3 
-----

- set_cookie sets cookie path to support multiple sites using this spark on the same domain
