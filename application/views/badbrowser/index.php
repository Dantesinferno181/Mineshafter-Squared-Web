    <h4>
        I am sorry about this, but Mineshafter Squared does not work with Internet Explorer. For a
        better experience on this site and the web in general consider
        <a href="http://dontuseie.com/">upgrading to a better browser.</a>
        You won't regret it and web developers will love you.

    <h4>
        I make an effort to support <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a>
        and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>.  Most other browsers work well too, just
        not Internet Explorer.  Due to the limited resources I have (mainly time) I can not put a lot of effort into
        supporting IE.
