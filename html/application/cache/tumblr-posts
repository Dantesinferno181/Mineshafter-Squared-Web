<p><strong>New user login and signup is still offline</strong>.  I have a few good ideas on how to fix the issue and keep the site operating normally.  If one of my ideas works, it will just limit the amount of requests I can make to the Mojang servers every hour.  I will play with the idea a bit more to see if it will work.  <span>I really do not have a lot of free time so if someone wants to help please read below.</span></p>
<p><strike><strong><span>MS^2&#160;3.0 is officially on hold.</span></strong></strike><strong><span> </span></strong><em>(Edit: It&#8217;s back on but at a very slow pace.  Find a way to help out if you want to see it done more quickly).</em><span> I just don&#8217;t have the time right now to re-invent the site.  If a few other things I am working on pan out quickly I may have time early next year to pick MS^2&#160;3.0 again (same thing goes for the alpha features some people were testing for me). Again, if anyone would like to help out with development please read below.  I want to truly open source the server side code, but I do need help maintaining it.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>How you can help.</strong>  Right now I primarily need some help with development (there is only so much I can do in the limited time I have to work on MS^2).  I would really like to build up a community of developers that help maintain and evolve MS^2. Keep in mind that I will share profits with some people who can consistently help out.  I also want to create a new forum or community area so anyone with experience in that area is also welcome to email me.  And once we get a good community area up we will probably need mods and the like.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Developers</strong><br/></span></p>
<p><span>The authentication server and website are written in PHP using the CodeIgniter framework. I use a MySQL database and use the PHP Active Record ORM to abstract it.  The client and server proxies are written in Java (as you probably already know).  If you understand most of that </span><span>and want to help develop the site and auth server please send me an email with the subject <strong>MS2 Development Help</strong>.  I am not looking to teach anyone how to program or use the tools the site utilizes, so you need to be okay with learning what parts you don&#8217;t know on your own.  </span></p>
<p><span>If a few people can help out, then I will be able to do more for MS^2 as well.  I don&#8217;t plan on offloading all the work to others as I still enjoy creating and maintaining MS^2, so you will be working with me.  I have not decided exactly what the game plan is for the future of MS^2 yet so you will also help shape the service moving forward.</span></p>
<p><strong>That is all for now.</strong></p>
<p><span>I hope we can keep the site going strong over the next few months.  If no one can help, the site may not be able to survive, only time will tell, but lets not let it come to that.  I will update this feed when I can, but please refer to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MineshafterSquared" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> for more frequent updates. </span></p>";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":15:{s:9:"blog_name";s:18:"mineshaftersquared";s:2:"id";d:35644858815;s:8:"post_url";s:75:"http://mineshaftersquared.tumblr.com/post/35644858815/about-mojang-accounts";s:4:"slug";s:21:"about-mojang-accounts";s:4:"type";s:4:"text";s:4:"date";s:23:"2012-11-13 18:22:54 GMT";s:9:"timestamp";i:1352830974;s:5:"state";s:9:"published";s:6:"format";s:4:"html";s:10:"reblog_key";s:8:"69oWEG0f";s:4:"tags";a:1:{i:0;s:6:"update";}s:11:"highlighted";a:0:{}s:10:"note_count";i:0;s:5:"title";s:21:"About Mojang Accounts";s:4:"body";s:1317:"<p>If its not one thing its the other.  I finally got the texture system fixed and now Mojang updated their accounts and put protections in.  This is a bit of a bump, but not a deal breaker.  What this means is I will have to create actual &#8220;MineshafterSquared&#8221; Accounts.  This is something I was trying to avoid doing for a multitude of reasons, but as it stands, I have to in order to keep Mineshafter Squared going.</p>
<p><strong>What this means </strong>- Right now you can&#8217;t sign up as a new Mineshafter Squared user. Anyone who already has linked their account with Mineshafter Squared will be able to keep their username  no problem there.  Once I get an accounts system set up, new users will be able to sign up, but may not be able to use their Minecraft username if someone else has already taken it.</p>
<p>This is going to change a few things game wise as well.  Currently premium, non-proxied, users can sign into MS2 game servers, this is most likely not work anymore with the changes I need to make.  A few other things in the same vein may stop working as well.  </p>
<p>This is something I have warned everyone about since the start so I am not too surprised.  I will keep as much functionality as I can, but the service may have to change a little to stay running.</p>";}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":15:{s:9:"blog_name";s:18:"mineshaftersquared";s:2:"id";d:35615434517;s:8:"post_url";s:64:"http://mineshaftersquared.tumblr.com/post/35615434517/ms2-update";s:4:"slug";s:10:"ms2-update";s:4:"type";s:4:"text";s:4:"date";s:23:"2012-11-13 03:34:23 GMT";s:9:"timestamp";i:1352777663;s:5:"state";s:9:"published";s:6:"format";s:4:"html";s:10:"reblog_key";s:8:"nJ8wJfDL";s:4:"tags";a:2:{i:0;s:11:"maintenance";i:1;s:6:"update";}s:11:"highlighted";a:0:{}s:10:"note_count";i:0;s:5:"title";s:10:"MS2 Update";s:4:"body";s:345:"<p>Hopefully by now you have heard that the texture uploader is back online!  I have also made a few performance tweaks to the site so it should be MUCH snappier and give you that NGINX error page a lot less.  If you are still getting that page, please let me know and I can increase the caching time for some of the pages.</p>
