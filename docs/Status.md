### In Early Development

Features In Progress
---------------------
These are the features that are currently in progress.  They generally contain a more detailed
breakdown of what is involved with finished items in **bold**
*   Announcements
    *   **Get feed from Tumblr**
    *   **Display feed from Tunblr**
    *   Make Responsive
        *   Re-organize when site gets too thin so there is only one announcement per line.
*   Downloads
    *   **Get Downloads from Database**
    *   Display downloads in block-themed format
        *   Group downloads by type (Client, Server, Other, Etc.)
        *   Modify database to include type description text
*   Add PHP MyAdmin to project to make database editing easy for everyone

Planned Features
-----------------
These are the very general features I have planned.  Most of which are replicating features from the current
site.  Those features should be finished more quickly since most of the code from the current site can be
reused.

*   Skin System
*   Cape System
*   Server List
*   Help System
*   User Forums
*   Game Authentication
*   Consolidation of Accounts
*   Server Admin Console
*   Server Status API
*   Fully responsive to fit any device

Finished Features
-----------------
These are the features that have been "finished" they may still need tweaking
but they are release-ready.

*   Nothing Yet
