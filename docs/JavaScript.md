Object Oriented JavaScript
--------------------------
JavaScript Objects are extremely important. Properly formatted JavaScript can ensure
cross-site compatibility and keep it easy to maintain and add features.  For proper
JavaScript Object Source Code formatting please use [JSOF](/KayoticSully/JSOF).

Auto loaded files
------------------
*   /assets/javascript/application.js
Contains any JavaScript that is needed at a site wrapper level

*   /assets/javascript/{controler_name}/*

>   Note: {controler_name} is a placeholder for what controller is currently
>   getting loaded.  For example if the "home" controller is loaded for any given
>   page, then home.js will get loaded if it exists.
