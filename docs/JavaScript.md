JavaScript
==========

Auto loaded files
------------------
*   __/assets/javascript/application.js__ Contains any JavaScript that is needed at a site wrapper level
*   __/assets/javascript/{controler_name}.js__

>   Note: **{controler_name}** is a placeholder for what controller is currently
>   getting loaded.  For example if the "home" controller is loaded for any given
>   page, then home.js will get loaded if it exists.

I have also been thinking about the possibility of auto-including a folder for all JavaScripts for the
current controller.  If that would seem to be more helpful that change will be made.
